# Object Oriented Programming in Python
This file contains basic and advanced about Object Oriented Programming in Python.
Some of the below concepts has been discussed --> 
  1) Object and Classes
  2) Encapsulation
  3) Inheritence
  4) Abstruct Class
In # main.py file , you will get most of the things .

2. **SOLID Principles**
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have one and only one reason to change.
   - **Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
   - **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes.
   - **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
   - **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules; both should depend on abstractions.

3. **Design Patterns**
   - **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. Both metaclass-based and `__new__`-based implementations are demonstrated.
   - **Strategy Pattern:** Enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. Examples include different shipping cost strategies based on flat rate and weight-based calculations.
